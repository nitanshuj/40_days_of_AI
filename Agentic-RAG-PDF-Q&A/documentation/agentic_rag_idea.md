# Understanding a Research paper - Q&A Chatbot
-------

## Agentic RAG - Step-by-Step Agentic RAG Chatbot Workflow

### 1. Document Ingestion and Chunking

- Parse the research paper: Extract plain text from the PDF or source file.
- Smart chunking: Divide text into coherent, context-preserving sections (e.g., by paragraph, section—abstract, methods, results).
- Store metadata: Track chunk position, section name, page number.

### 2. Chunk Embedding and Vector Store
- Embed all chunks: Generate embeddings of each chunk using a semantic model.
- Persist in vector store: Use Faiss, Chroma, Milvus, etc., with metadata for chunks.

### 3. Chatbot Session Initialization
- Session memory/context: For each user/chatbot session, store:
- Chat history (previous queries and answers)
- Any insight or facts the agent has already found

### 4. User Question/Input
- User asks any question (can be fact-based, complex, or multi-step):
- E.g., “Summarize the methods, then compare findings with discussion.”

### 5. Agentic Intent Recognition
The agent parses the query:
- Checks for complex requests, reasoning, chaining, or multiple subtasks.
- Splits the main question into subtasks if needed:
    - Task 1: Summarize methods
    - Task 2: Extract findings from results
    - Task 3: Compare findings with discussion

### 6. Contextual Retrieval (for Each Subtask)

For each subtask:
- Embed sub-task question
- Search vector store for relevant chunks (use metadata to target specific sections)
- Retrieve top N relevant chunks

### 7. Dynamic Prompt Construction
For each agent step:

- Construct user prompt:

```
Use this context from the 'Methods' section to summarize the methodology:
[methods chunks...]
```

- For chaining:
    - Store result in session context/memory
    - Use outputs as inputs for next step

- Example prompt for chaining:


```
First, summarize the Methods based on this context.
Then, using Results and Discussion sections, compare findings.
If you have already found important details in earlier steps, refer to them.
```

### 8. Multi-Step LLM Invocation via Ollama
Send prompt to Ollama LLM for each reasoning step.

Agent can ask the LLM for clarification or more evidence if its output is not sufficient (“Was this methodology unique compared to the discussion section's comments?”).

Store each output as part of chatbot context for user reference and follow-ups.

### 9. Output and Conversation Continuation

Present results to the user in the chat interface.

Allow follow-ups:
User can clarify, ask further, or “dig deeper”—previous context/history is considered.
Agent maintains context to avoid repeating work, reason with earlier answers, and chain queries.


### 10. Conversation Memory / Multi-Turn QA
As the conversation progresses, the agent:
Uses history for context to improve retrieval and answer quality.
Can refer back to earlier steps or answers.
Adapts retrieval to cover missing information or fill knowledge gaps.

## Key Differences From Simple RAG
1. **Chaining**: Agent splits questions into subtasks, sequences retrievals, and composes answers from multi-step reasoning.
2. **Memory**: Each chat session keeps context, earlier answers, and facts.
3. **Interaction**: System asks clarifying questions, follows up, adapts approach based on user responses.
4. **Multi-ste**p: The final answer may be composed from several LLM calls, each focused on different sections or tasks.

### Example Chatbot Agentic RAG Use Case

`User`: “Summarize the methods. Then, are any findings challenged in the discussion?”

`Agent`:

1. Retrieves and summarizes methods section.

2. Retrieves results and discussion sections.

3. Searches for challenges/contradictions to findings in discussion, referencing both context chunks and previous agent answers.

4. Responds in chat: "The methods used were X... Findings Y were challenged in discussion by Z..."

### Benefits

- Handles complex, multi-step questions and dialogue.
- Leverages prior context—more like a true research assistant.
- Supports clarifications, corrections, deep dives, and sophisticated QA flows.

This is a full agentic loop—multi-hop, conversation-aware, and with chaining—using Ollama’s LLM as the final answer engine. Perfect for research paper analytics!
